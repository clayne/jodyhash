This is Jody Bruchon's hashing function and a very simple command-line tool
to produce hexadecimal hash strings (and also to show how to use jody_hash).
It can be built to produce 64-bit, 32-bit, and 16-bit hash variants. When
building, the default is 64-bit, but can be overridden like so:

make CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DJODY_HASH_WIDTH=32

This will generate a 32-bit width version of the program. Obviously, the
different widths are incompatible with each other. The program will tell
you what bit width it was built for when invoked with the -v option.

If you wish to plug jodyhash into any place where md5sum, sha1sum, and
friends are already used, there is a basic compatibility option '-s' that
will print hashes plus file names with a leading asterisk. Remember that
jodyhash is not a "secure hash function" so don't use it as a signature
mechanism for authenticating anything!

The home page for this program is:
